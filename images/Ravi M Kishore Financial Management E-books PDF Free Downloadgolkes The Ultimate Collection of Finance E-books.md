## Step 2: Connect the network dongle
 
DDS CAD 7 3 requires a network dongle to run. A network dongle is a small device that plugs into a USB port on your computer or server and acts as a license key for the software. You will need to install the Dongle Server software on the computer or server where you want to connect the network dongle. You can download the Dongle Server software from the website of Thales, the manufacturer of the network dongle. After installing the Dongle Server software, insert the network dongle into a USB port on the computer or server.
 
## Step 3: Configure the network license
 
Next, you need to configure the network license for DDS CAD 7 3. This means that you need to specify how many workstations can access the software at the same time, and what kind of access they have to the building model in DDS CAD. You can do this by editing the options for the dongle in DDS CAD. You can either select via the Help menu Dongle -> Edit options for dongle or click on the Options button in the License check failure dialog. Select the tab Sentinel SuperPro and enter the IP address or host name of the computer or server where you have connected the network dongle[^2^]. You can also adjust the number of licenses and access rights for each workstation.
 
## Step 4: Start using DDS CAD 7 3
 
Now you are ready to start using DDS CAD 7 3. You can launch the software from your desktop or start menu, and select which module you want to use: electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilation or air conditioning. You can create a new project or open an existing one, and start designing and engineering your building services systems. You can also import and export data from other BIM software, such as Revit or ArchiCAD. DDS CAD 7 3 offers you a range of features and functions to help you work efficiently and accurately.
 
## Conclusion
 
DDS CAD 7 3 is a versatile and powerful software for building services design and engineering. To install and use it, you need to download the software, connect the network dongle, configure the network license and start using it. If you need any assistance or support, you can contact DDScad via their website[^1^] or use their Remote Support tool[^1^]. With DDS CAD 7 3, you can create high-quality building services projects that meet your clients' needs and expectations.
