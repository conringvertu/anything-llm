# How to Add Iron Sights to Fallout 3 with RH\_IronSights Mod
 
Fallout 3 is a great game, but it lacks one feature that many players find essential: iron sights. Iron sights are a way of aiming your weapon by aligning the front and rear sights on your target, instead of using a crosshair. Iron sights can make shooting more realistic, immersive, and challenging.
 
Fortunately, there is a mod that can add iron sights to Fallout 3: RH\_IronSights. This mod adds centered iron sight animations to most vanilla guns, as well as some custom weapons from other mods. It also adjusts the accuracy, recoil, and sway of the weapons to make them more balanced and realistic.

In this article, we will show you how to install and use RH\_IronSights mod for Fallout 3. You will need the following requirements:
 
- Fallout 3 with all DLCs installed
- Fallout Script Extender (FOSE)
- ArchiveInvalidation Invalidated
- Command Extender
- lStewieAl's Tweaks
- Updated Unofficial Fallout 3 Patch

You can download these mods from Nexus Mods or other sources. Make sure to follow the installation instructions for each mod carefully.
 
## Step 1: Install RH\_IronSights
 
Download RH\_IronSights mod from [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/6938). Extract the contents of the archive to your Fallout 3 data folder. You should see a folder called RH\_IronSights and a file called RH\_IronSights.esp in your data folder.
 
Launch Fallout 3 Launcher and click on Data Files. Check the box next to RH\_IronSights.esp and click OK. Alternatively, you can use a mod manager like Nexus Mod Manager or Mod Organizer to activate the mod.
 
## Step 2: Enable True Iron Sights in lStewieAl's Tweaks
 
Download lStewieAl's Tweaks mod from [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/23631). Extract the contents of the archive to your Fallout 3 data folder. You should see a file called lStewieAl's Tweaks.ini in your data folder.
 
Open lStewieAl's Tweaks.ini with a text editor like Notepad. Find the line that says bSightingNodeSupport = 0 and change it to bSightingNodeSupport = 1. Save and close the file.
 
This will enable true iron sights support in lStewieAl's Tweaks, which is required for RH\_IronSights to work properly.
