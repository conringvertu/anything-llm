If you are looking for a virtual instrument that can deliver realistic and expressive bass sounds, you might want to check out Spectrasonics Trilian. Trilian is a comprehensive bass module that features acoustic, electric and synth basses, powered by the next generation STEAM Engine technology. Trilian is the successor to Spectrasonics' award-winning Trilogy bass instrument, and it offers deeper control of musical expression and much greater flexibility of sound shaping. Trilian's 34GB library is 10-times the size of Trilogy and features all new acoustic, electric and synth basses.
 
One of the most impressive features of Trilian is its integration with Spectrasonics' flagship synth Omnisphere. This means that you can use Trilian's sounds within the Omnisphere environment for further sound design and keyboard/bass splits. You can also access Omnisphere's vast library of sounds and effects from Trilian's interface. This opens up a whole new world of sonic possibilities for your bass tracks.

Whether you need a warm upright bass, a funky slap bass, a deep synth bass, or anything in between, Trilian has you covered.

Spectrasonics Trilian is a must-have for any bass lover or producer who wants to add some low-end punch and groove to their music. With its amazing sound quality, versatility, and integration with Omnisphere, Trilian is the ultimate bass solution for Mac users.

One of the questions that many Trilian users have is how to use Trilian with Omnisphere. As we mentioned before, Trilian fully integrates as a Satellite Instrument within the Omnisphere interface, which means that you can access Trilian's sounds and effects from Omnisphere's browser and controls. This also means that you can combine Trilian's bass sounds with Omnisphere's synth sounds for creating unique and powerful bass layers.
 
To use Trilian with Omnisphere, you need to have both instruments installed and authorized on your Mac. Then, you can launch Omnisphere as a standalone application or as a plugin in your DAW. In the Omnisphere browser, you will see a new directory called "Trilian Library" that contains all the Trilian patches and soundsources. You can load any Trilian patch by clicking on it, and it will automatically display the Trilian Custom Controls page that brings together all the most useful parameters of that patch. You can also switch to the Omnisphere interface by clicking on the OMNISPHERE CONTROLS button in the top left of Trilian's interface. This will allow you to access Omnisphere's synthesis engine and effects for further sound design.
 
For performances, you could use Stack Mode or Live Mode to create useful combinations of Trilian basses and Omnisphere synth sounds[^1^]. Try using keyboard or velocity splits, layering, or apply Part switching to a Multi in Live Mode. You can also use Omnisphere's powerful arpeggiator, groove lock, and modulation matrix to add some movement and variation to your bass parts. The possibilities are endless when you use Trilian with Omnisphere.
