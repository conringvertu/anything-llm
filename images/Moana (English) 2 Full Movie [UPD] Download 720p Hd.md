# Moana 2: Is There a Sequel to the Disney Animated Movie?
 
Moana is a 2016 Disney animated movie that follows the adventures of a young Polynesian princess who sets sail to find the legendary demigod Maui and restore the heart of Te Fiti, a goddess who created all life. The movie was a huge success, earning over $690 million worldwide and receiving critical acclaim for its animation, music, voice acting, and cultural representation.
 
Many fans have been wondering if there will be a sequel to Moana, as Disney has been known to produce follow-ups to some of its popular animated movies, such as Frozen 2, Wreck-It Ralph 2, and The Incredibles 2. However, as of now, there is no official confirmation or announcement from Disney about Moana 2. The directors of Moana, Ron Clements and John Musker, have also stated that they have no plans for a sequel at the moment.

However, this does not mean that Moana 2 is impossible. Disney has sometimes taken a long time to make sequels to its movies, such as Finding Dory, which came out 13 years after Finding Nemo, or Toy Story 4, which came out nine years after Toy Story 3. There is also a lot of potential for exploring more stories and characters in the world of Moana, such as her ancestors, her island community, and other mythical creatures and lands.
 
For now, fans who want to watch more of Moana can enjoy the short film Gone Fishing, which was released with the DVD and Blu-ray of Moana in 2017. The short film features Maui and Moana on a fishing trip that goes awry. Fans can also watch Moana on Disney+ Hotstar[^1^], or download it from Internet Archive[^2^] or Dailymotion[^3^]. However, these sources may not offer the best quality or legality of the movie.
 
Moana 2 may not be in the works right now, but that does not mean it will never happen. Disney may surprise us with an announcement in the future, or maybe even a spin-off series or a prequel. Until then, we can always revisit the original movie and enjoy its beautiful animation, music, and message.

It also reached number two on the US Billboard 200 chart and number one on the US Soundtrack Albums chart. The soundtrack has been praised for its diversity, authenticity, and creativity.
 
Another reason why Moana is a great movie is its animation, which showcases the stunning beauty of the Pacific Islands and the ocean. The animation team used advanced technology and techniques to create realistic water effects, hair movements, facial expressions, and lighting. They also consulted with experts and cultural advisors to ensure that the movie was respectful and accurate to the Polynesian culture and history.
