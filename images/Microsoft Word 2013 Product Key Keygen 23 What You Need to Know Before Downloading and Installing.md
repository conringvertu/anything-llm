A product key is a 25-digit code that verifies that you have purchased a genuine copy of Microsoft Office 2013. It looks like this: XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX. You can find your product key in different ways depending on how you acquired your copy of Microsoft Office 2013. For example:
 
- If you bought a boxed version of Microsoft Office 2013, you can find the product key inside the product box.
- If you bought a new computer that came pre-installed with Microsoft Office 2013, you can contact the retailer for the product key.
- If you bought Microsoft Office 2013 online from Microsoft or an authorized dealer, you can find the product key in your order confirmation email.

If you don't have a product key or you lost it, you can try to use one of the free product keys that are available online. However, these product keys may not work or may be already used by someone else. Therefore, it is recommended that you buy a genuine product key from Microsoft or a third-party seller.
