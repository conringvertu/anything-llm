Sarkar 3 is the third film in Ram Gopal Varma's Sarkar trilogy, which chronicles the exploits of a powerful political figure, Subhash Nagre (Amitabh Bachchan), and his family. The film was released in 2017 and is a sequel to Sarkar (2005) and Sarkar Raj (2008).
 
The plot revolves around the conflict between Sarkar and the unscrupulous builder lobby over a plot of land to be re-developed. After the death of both his sons, Sarkar is now ably supported by his two lieutenants, Gokul (Ronit Roy) and Raman (Parag Tyagi), who is mute. His grandson, Shivaji (Amit Sadh), the son of his estranged son Vishnu (Kay Kay Menon), who was killed by his brother Shankar (Abhishek Bachchan) in the first film, comes back into his life and things take a turn for the worse.

The film also features Manoj Bajpayee as Govind Deshpande, a rebellious politician who opposes Sarkar; Jackie Shroff as Michael Vallya, a Dubai-based businessman who plots against Sarkar; Yami Gautam as Annu Karkare, a woman who seeks revenge for her father's death at the hands of Sarkar; and Rohini Hattangadi as Rukku Bai Devi, an old rival of Sarkar.
 
The film is a political thriller with dark overtones, exploring themes such as power, loyalty, betrayal, and revenge. The film received mixed reviews from critics and audiences, who praised Bachchan's performance but criticized the screenplay, direction, and editing. The film was also a box office failure, grossing only Rs. 9.93 crore in India.

The film also suffers from poor performances by most of the supporting cast, who fail to match up to Bachchan's charisma and intensity. Bajpayee, Shroff, and Gautam are wasted in one-dimensional roles, while Sadh tries too hard to imitate Bachchan's mannerisms. Roy and Tyagi are decent, but they do not have much scope to shine. The only actor who stands out is Hattangadi, who plays a cunning and ruthless politician with aplomb.
 
The film's technical aspects are also disappointing, especially the cinematography and editing. The camera angles are often awkward and distracting, while the cuts are abrupt and jarring. The background score is loud and intrusive, while the songs are forgettable. The dialogues are also clichÃ©d and repetitive, with Bachchan often resorting to his trademark monologues.
 
Sarkar 3 is a letdown for fans of the Sarkar franchise and Ram Gopal Varma. It is a dull and uninspired film that does not do justice to its premise or its protagonist. It is a film that can be easily skipped, unless you are a die-hard fan of Amitabh Bachchan.
  
The film also failed to impress at the box office, earning only Rs. 7.60 crore in India as of May 16, 2017[^1^]. The film opened with Rs. 2.10 crore on its first day, but witnessed a decline over the weekend, earning Rs. 2.25 crore on Saturday and Rs. 2.50 crore on Sunday[^2^]. The film also performed poorly overseas, grossing only $358,928 worldwide as of May 25, 2017[^3^]. The film was released in 107 theaters in North America, but could not attract enough audience[^4^].

The film's poor performance can be attributed to various factors, such as the lack of novelty in the story, the negative reviews from critics and audiences, the competition from other films like Baahubali 2: The Conclusion and Meri Pyaari Bindu, and the low buzz and promotion around the film. The film also faced some controversies before its release, such as the Central Board of Film Certification's objection to some scenes and dialogues, and the legal notice sent by Narendra Hirawat & Co., who claimed to have acquired the rights of Sarkar franchise from Varma.
 
Sarkar 3 is a disappointing end to the Sarkar trilogy, which started with a promising and gripping first film in 2005. The film fails to live up to the expectations of the fans and the critics, and does not do justice to the legacy of Bachchan's iconic character. It is a film that could have been much better, had Varma paid more attention to the script, direction, and editing.
