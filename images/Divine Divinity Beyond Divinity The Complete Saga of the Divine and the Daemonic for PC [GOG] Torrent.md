# Divine Divinity Beyond Divinity: A Review of the Epic RPG Series
 
If you are a fan of classic action role-playing games with a rich story and a vast world to explore, you might want to check out Divine Divinity and Beyond Divinity, two games by Larian Studios that are now available on Steam. These games offer a unique blend of hack-and-slash combat, classless character development, and interaction galore.
 
Divine Divinity was released in 2002 and received critical acclaim for its immersive gameplay and award-winning soundtrack. The game lets you choose between three classes: warrior, wizard, or survivor, each with their own special ability. You can then customize your character with 96 skills, regardless of your class. The game features a huge world with over 100 hours of content, filled with non-linear quests and secrets to discover. You can also create potions, enchant weapons, and craft items using the objects you find in the environment.

Beyond Divinity is the follow-up to Divine Divinity, released in 2004. The game takes place 20 years after the events of the first game, and introduces a new twist: you are soul-forged with a Death Knight, a creature of evil that you have to cooperate with to break the curse. You can switch control between your avatar and the Death Knight at any time, and use their abilities to overcome challenges. The game also features a randomly generated universe called the Battlefields, where you can find loot, enemies, and new quests. Beyond Divinity offers over 60 hours of gameplay, with more skills, items, and enemies than the first game.
 
Both games have been re-mastered to support Windows 7 and higher resolutions, and are available for $5.99 each on Steam. You can also buy them as part of the Divinity Anthology or the Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Eternal Edition packages, which include other games from the Divinity series. If you are looking for an epic RPG experience that will keep you hooked for hours, you should give Divine Divinity and Beyond Divinity a try.

The Divinity series has evolved over the years, spanning across seven games, two novels, a graphic novel, lore book and board game. The series can be broadly divided into three eras based on the game style and genre: the first era (2002-2006) features 2D real time combat RPGs, the second era (2006-2014) uses the Gamebryo engine for 3D action RPGs, and the third era (2013-present) employs the Divinity Engine for isometric turn-based RPGs.

The series is set in a fantasy world called Rivellon, where magic and technology coexist. The world is governed by the Seven Gods, who are also known as the Divine. The main theme of the series is the struggle between good and evil, and the role of free will and destiny. The series also explores the concept of Source, a powerful but corrupting energy that can be used for creation or destruction. [^3^]
 
The series has received critical acclaim for its rich story, deep gameplay, and immersive world. The most successful games in the series are Divinity: Original Sin (2014) and Divinity: Original Sin II (2017), which have sold over 5 million copies combined. [^1^] These games feature a cooperative multiplayer mode, a highly interactive environment, and a complex character creation system. The games also allow players to create their own adventures using the Divinity Engine 2 toolset. [^1^]
