A lan crack is a software that allows you to bypass the game's protection and play it online without using Steam. This way, you can join or host private servers with your friends who also have the lan crack. However, using a lan crack is illegal and risky, as it can expose your computer to viruses, malware, or legal actions. Therefore, we do not recommend or endorse using a lan crack for any game.
 
But if you still want to try it at your own risk, here are the steps you need to follow:
 
1. Download the lan crack from a reliable source. You can find one on MegaGames[^1^] or YouTube[^3^], but be careful of fake or malicious links.
2. Extract the lan crack files to your game folder, where the SniperEliteNZA2.exe file is located. You might need to overwrite some files, so make a backup first.
3. Download and install Tunngle, a VPN software that allows you to create or join virtual lan networks. You can get it from [https://www.tunngle.net/en/](https://www.tunngle.net/en/).
4. Create an account on Tunngle and log in. Then, search for Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 in the network browser and join one of the available networks.
5. Launch the game from the lan crack launcher (SniperEliteNZA2\_Launcher.exe) and go to Options > Network. Set your nickname and make sure that Lan Mode is enabled.
6. Go to Co-op > Lan Game and either create or join a server. You should see the servers hosted by other players who are using Tunngle.
7. Enjoy playing Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 online with your friends!

Note: If you experience any problems with the game, such as black screen, crashes, or low performance, try disabling any programs that interfere with the game's graphics settings, such as Afterburner or Fraps. Also, check the Steam forums for updates on how to fix common issues or wait for a patch that addresses them.
 
We hope this article was helpful for you. However, we remind you that using a lan crack is illegal and risky, and we do not support piracy in any way. If you like Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2, we encourage you to buy it from Steam or other official sources and support the developers who made this awesome game.

The game consists of five levels that you have to complete in order to stop the Nazi zombie army. Each level has different objectives, enemies, and challenges that you have to overcome. You can use your sniper rifle, your secondary weapon, your pistol, and your melee attack to kill the zombies. You can also use traps, explosives, and environmental hazards to your advantage. You have to be careful of your ammo, health, and stamina levels, as they are limited and scarce. You can find ammo boxes, health kits, and safe rooms throughout the levels to replenish them.
 
The game rewards you with points for every kill you make, depending on factors such as distance, accuracy, headshots, combo kills, etc. You can also earn bonus points for completing optional objectives or finding collectibles. Your points are added to your score at the end of each level. You can compare your score with other players on the online leaderboards or on Tunngle.
